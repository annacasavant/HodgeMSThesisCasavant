This is the public repository for Anna Casavant's, M.S. Mechanical Engineering @ CU-Boulder, thesis. The thesis is adviced by Bri-Mathias Hodge of the Renewable and Sustainble Energy Institute and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 

The research explored in this thesis pertains to the integration of long duration energy storage systems onto power systems with high renewable energy penetration. 

# Research Questions

1. How does modeling the integration of LDES as a price-maker effect the electricty market?
2. How does modeling the integration of LDES in a PCM using multiple scenarios regarding state of charge data impact the chronological operation of the power system? 
3. How does the spatial variability of LDES effectthe chronological operation of the power systems?
